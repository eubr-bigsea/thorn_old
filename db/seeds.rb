# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#User.create(first_name: 'Matheus', last_name: 'Gon√ßalves', email: 'souzagonc@gmail.com', password: '123456', id: 6)
